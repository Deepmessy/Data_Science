## Project 1: **Wine Data Naive Bayes classifier**
### (https://www.kaggle.com/code/deepmessy/wine-data-naive-bayes-classifier-gaussian/notebook)

### In statistics, naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple "probabilistic classifiers" based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions between the features. They are among the simplest Bayesian network models, but coupled with kernel density estimation, they can achieve high accuracy levels. This is a project in which i have worked on predicting the outcomes of a classification problem using the naive bayes method for gaussian dataset.
