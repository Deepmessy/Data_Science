[]Wine Data Naive Bayes classifier (https://www.kaggle.com/code/deepmessy/wine-data-naive-bayes-classifier-gaussian/notebook) 
# In statistics, naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple "probabilistic classifiers" based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions between the features. They are among the simplest Bayesian network models, but coupled with kernel density estimation, they can achieve high accuracy levels.#
