## Project 1: **Wine Data Naive Bayes classifier**

### In statistics, naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple "probabilistic classifiers" based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions between the features. They are among the simplest Bayesian network models, but coupled with kernel density estimation, they can achieve high accuracy levels. This is a project in which i have worked on predicting the outcomes of a classification problem using the naive bayes method for gaussian dataset.


## Project 2: **Boston DF with XGRegressor model**

### XGBoostRegressor is a machine learning algorithm that is widely used for regression tasks, such as predicting house prices, stock prices, or customer churn rates. This algorithm is particularly useful for handling large datasets, dealing with missing values, and identifying important features. XGBoostRegressor project involves building and fine-tuning a regression model using XGBoost, with the goal of achieving the highest possible accuracy on a given dataset. Such projects require expertise in data preprocessing, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation, making them a great way for data scientists to sharpen their skills.


## Project 3: **Exploratory Data analysis**

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial first step in any data science project. EDA involves understanding the characteristics of a dataset, identifying patterns and trends, and checking for any anomalies or inconsistencies. By conducting EDA, data scientists can gain valuable insights into the data and develop a hypothesis for modeling. EDA projects often involve visualizing data using various statistical and graphical techniques, such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps. The main goal of an EDA project is to uncover the underlying patterns and relationships in the data that can help inform subsequent analysis and decision-making.
